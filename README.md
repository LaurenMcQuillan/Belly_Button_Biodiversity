# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive webpage so that study participants can select their test subject ID and view the belly button bacteria data that was collected in their sample. The dashboard contains a bar chart that displays the top ten bacterial species collected for each subject, a gauge chart that displays the number of times the subject washes their belly button per week, and a bubble chart that displays the bacteria cultures present in the subjects collected sample.
